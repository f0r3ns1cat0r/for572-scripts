# This script will traverse a directory tree full of pcap files and run a set 
#   of commands against each pcap file.
# As distributed, it's designed to handle the capstone data in FOR572, but you
#   can adjust it as needed for other situations.

# Set thsese two variables as needed.  Be mindful of the space available in
#   $DESTDIRROOT, as the commands below may require a LOT of disk space!

    # Uncomment these three commands to process with Zeek
    # This will take a LONG time and require a LOT of disk space! You probably
    #   DO NOT want to do this to ALL the capstone pcaps!!

    # uncomment these two commands to process with nfpcapd
    # This is not needed for the FOR572 capstone, as youâ€™ve been provided with
    #   NetFlow that covers well beyond the pcap data, but the command is here
    #   for your reference and future use as needed
